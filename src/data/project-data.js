If you've ever been to one you know exactly what I'm talking about. Long blog posts about some person's life that goes on for far too long and has a million pop ups. This app is a streamlined version of those recipes. Add the ingredients and the instructions, an image if you'd like, and you're off to the kitchen. An app designed for less talking, and more lip smackin. Welcome to Smack-Talk.",
